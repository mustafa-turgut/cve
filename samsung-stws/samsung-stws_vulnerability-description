To exploit this vulnerability the attacker must be in the same internal network where victim is. If this condition is satisfied then the attacker can do MITM attacks to sniff network packets and capture the relevant packet that includes the login request victim made. After capturing this packet the attacker can easily decode the base 64 encoded password.
